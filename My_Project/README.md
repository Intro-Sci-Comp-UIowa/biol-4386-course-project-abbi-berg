# Light intensity induces homosexual like courtship behavior in Drosphila Melanogaster

This repo was created in Spring of 2021 for the class BIOL:4386 taught by Bin He. It outlines the process 
to produce a figure that displays how drosphila homosexual like courtship behavior
can be induced with intense light.

## Introduction
Courtship behaviors between male and female drosophila have been
extensively studied, however more recently, courtship behaviors between only 
male drosophila have been discovered and the factors that influence this 
behavior is the subject of our study. Traditionally, in order to engage in 
courtship with a female, a male drosophila must perform a courtship ritual to 
entice the female. The male will first begin this ritual by orienting 
themselves in the direction of the female and will chase the female around. 
Next the male fly will tap the female flys abdomen then extend its wing out and vibrate 
it to produce a courtship song. The final step in courtship before copulation 
is that the male will lick the genitalia of the female. If all goes well the 
end result will be copulation between the sexes. Some of these courtship 
behaviors have been found to exist even in male only populations. Most 
interestingly, male drosophila will orient themselves to one another and chase 
each other around so that they from chains and sometimes even loops of male 
flies. Male flies will also extend their wing and produce a courtship song 
even when no females are present.

It is unknown why male drosophila would perform these courtship specific 
behaviors when females are not present. In my lab we are studying what 
influences the presence of these behaviors, specifically we have found that 
male-male drosophila courtship behaviors become more frequent when the 
intensity of white light is increased with the most courtship behavior 
occuring at 17,000 lux white light. We have observed this by placing male 
drosophila in flat ‘arenas’ in which the courtship behaviors (specifically the 
wing extension, chasing, and chaining behaviors) are observed and the frequency 
of these behaviors is noted. We are able to use LED lighting that can be made 
more or less intense to then observe the frequency of behavior. A control 
experiment is also done including equal parts male and female flies and light 
intensity has shown to have less effect on the frequency of courtship between males 
and females. 

### Figure to reproduce
For the purposes of this project, would like to produce a figure that is 
effective at displaying how increasing light intensity increases the frequency 
of male-male courtship behavior in drosophila, whereas male female courtship 
frequency is much less effected by the intensity of light.

I will plan to reproduce a modified version of Figure 1 from Lumley, 
Michalczyk, et al.

Figure one. A line graph with SEM bars at each point. For this projects 
purposes, the actual information presented in this graph is less relevent than the 
format of the figure itself. I would like to modify a version of this figure so that
points on the line would represent the frequency of each courtship event. The X axis would
in turn represent each time point (total 48 time points) with the light intensity increasing
each 12 points. One line would then represent the trials of only male flies and the other 
would be of trial with both males and females present. The error bars would represent the 
standard deviation.
