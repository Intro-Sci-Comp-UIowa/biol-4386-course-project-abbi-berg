# Light Protocol Data
Data was aquired to test the hypothesis that intense light induces courtship behavior
between male drosphila.

## Acquiring Data

Data was acquired under the supervision of Dr. Wu and Dr. Ueda in coordination with
the University of Iowa Biology research facilities. 

The excel document was uploaded on March 12, 2021. Data was collected February 2021.

8 minute videos of male-male and male-female trails have been taken. Flies were exposed
to each light setting for 2 minutes and the light intensity began at 400 lux then increased 
to 700 lux, 10,000 lux and 17,000 lux in that order. 

Male-male trials contained 8 male flies in an chamber and Male-female trials contained 
4 male flies and 4 virgin female flies in each chamber. Male flies were 14 to 17 days 
old were separated into male only vials on the day they emerged from their pupal stage. 
For our purposes the flies are considered 0 days old when collected. Virgin female flies 
were collected similarly and are aged 3 to 7 days.

Videos were analyzed by hand. The presence of a wing extension, chasing or chaining event 
was recorded to have or not have happened in a 5 second time window. 5 seconds of observation 
were followed by 5 seconds of no observation and then the process was repeated. Each chamber was observed 
for a total of 1 minute per light intensity setting. The total number of times that an event
occurred was recorded for each video at each light intensity. The maximum number of times
an event could be present for each light intensity is 12 times.
