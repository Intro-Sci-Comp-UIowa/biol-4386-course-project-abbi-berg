Data was aquired to test the hypothesis that intense light induces courtship behavior
between male drosphila.

## Data aquisision

Data was aquired under the supervision of Dr. Wu and Dr. Ueda in cordination with
the University of Iowa Biology research facilities. 

The excel document was uploaded on March 12, 2021. Data was collected Febuary 2021.

8 minute videos of male-male and male-female trails have been taken. Male-male trials
inclued 8 male flies contained in an chamber. Male-female trials contained 4 male flies
and 4 virgin female flies. Male flies were 14 to 17 days old were seperated into male 
only vials on the day they emerged from their puple stage. For our purposes the flies
are considered 0 days old when collected. Vigin female flies were collected similarly
and are aged 3 to 7 days.
Every 2 minutes throughout the video, the light intensity is increases begining with 
400 lux light then increasing to 700 lux, 10,000 lux and 17,000 lux. 
The presence of a wing extension, chasing or chaining event is recorded 12 times 
throughout each 2 min. period. Of the 2 min. each chamber was observed for 1 min. 
The observer analyses the presence (yes or no) of each event for 5 secs between 2 chambers
throughout the course of the video.
