# Updated pipeline to create line graph
Using ‘R’ I will…
1.	I will use preexisting data that indicates the presence of a courtship event at 96 intervals 
  (12 intervals for each 2 min. light intensity period) to find the average number of occurrences 
  of the 10 videos. I will also find the top and bottom 25 percentile range. 
2.	I will then need to plot the averages for the male only and male-female trial. 
  I will need to add error bars for each of the points. 
3.	I will then need to add color to the background of the graph to show the intensity of 
  light increases every 2 min.
