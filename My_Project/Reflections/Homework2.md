# Reflection from HW1
From my homework 1 feedback, I was made aware that my description of the intensity of light was unclear. 
I addressed this by adding the specific light measurements to my introduction. It was also suggested that 
I add a fourth plot to show differences in male-male and male-female courtship. This would help illustrate 
that the light intensity effects male-male courtship more significantly than it effect male-female courtship. 
This is a great idea. My only concern is that while my data shows the intense light has a greater effect on 
male-male courtship than male female courtship, I am not sure to what magnitude. Also, male-male directed 
courtship is included in the male-female quantification of behavior because when counting the presence of each 
behavior it is difficult to distinguish if the behavior what sex the behavior was directed towards. I still 
would like to explore this more.
