# Increase light intensity enhances male-male courtship behavior

Courtship behaviors and rituals between male and female drosophila have been extensively studied, however more recently, 
courtship behaviors between only male drosophila have been discovered and the factors that influence this behavior is 
the subject of our study. Traditionally, in order to engage in courtship with a female, a male drosophila must perform a 
courtship ritual to entice the female. The male will first begin this ritual by orienting themselves in the direction of 
the female and will chase the female around. Next the male fly will tap the female fly and extend its wing out and vibrate 
it to produce a courtship song. The final step in courtship before copulation is that the male will lick the genitalia of 
the female. If all goes well the end result will be copulation between the sexes. Some of these courtship behaviors have 
been found to exist even in male only populations. Most interestingly, male drosophila will orient themselves to one 
another and chase each other around so that they from chains and sometimes even loops of male flies. Male flies will also 
extend their wing and produce a courtship song even when no females are present.
  
It is unknown why male drosophila would perform these courtship specific behaviors when females are not present. In my lab 
we are studying what influences the intensity of these behaviors, specifically we have found that male-male drosophila 
courtship behaviors become more frequent when the intensity of white light is increased. We have observed this by placing 
male drosophila in flat ‘areas’ in which the courtship behaviors (specifically the wing extension, chasing, and chaining 
behaviors) are observed and the frequency of these behaviors is noted. We are able to use LED lighting that can be made more 
or less intense to then observe the frequency of behavior. A control experiment is also done including equal parts male and 
female flies and light intensity has not shown to change the frequency of courtship between males and females. 

For the purposes of this project, would like to produce a figure that is effective at displaying how increasing light 
intensity increases the frequency of male-male courtship behavior in drosophila, whereas male female courtship frequency 
is much less effected by the intensity of light.

I will plan to reproduce a modified version of Figure 1 from Lumley, Michalczyk, et al. 

# Data Defined 

8 minute videos of male-male and male-female trails have been taken. Every 2 minutes throughout the video, the light intensity 
is increases. The presence of a wing extension, chasing or chaining event is recorded 12 times throughout each 2 min. light interval. 
Ten 8 min. videos have been recorded. I would like to produce three figures for each courtship event (wing extension, chasing 
and chaining). For each event I would like to produce something that looks similar to the above in which the red line would represent 
the male-female trial and the blue would represent the male only trial. On the X-axis would be the time elapsed and the Y-axis would 
be called the frequency of each particular courtship event. Each point on the graph would be the average number of times the courtship 
event was observed of the total 10 videos with 1.0 being that the event was observed in all of the videos within the interval of time. 
There would be 12 total intervals for each 2 min. period of time. 

See the drawing bellow for reference on how I intend to apply above line-graph technique for my purposes…

 

I would also like to highlight each 2 min. section of the line graph with an increasing shade of color to indicate that the 
intensity of light is increasing in each 2 min. time period. Figure A then would represent wing extension events, Figure B chasing 
events and Figure C chaining events. Like in the Figure 1 from Lumley, Michalczyk, et al, I would also like to add s.e.m. lines like 
to each point that would represent the top 25th percentile of the time and bottom 25th percentile to each point. 

# Pipeline
In summary, 
1.	I will use preexisting data that indicates the presence of a courtship event at 96 intervals (12 intervals for each 2 min. 
light intensity period) to find the average number of occurrences of the 10 videos. I will also find the top and bottom 25 percentile range. 
2.	I will then need to plot the averages for the male only and male-female trial. I will need to add error bars for each of the points. 
3.	I will then need to add color to the background of the graph to show the intensity of light increases every 2 min.
